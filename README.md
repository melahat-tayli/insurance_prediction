# Insurance Prediction for Cars

## About this Project
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classification model capable of accurately predicting whether a customer will purchase car insurance. To achieve this, I implemented several classification algorithms and employed hyperparameter tuning techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.


### Tools

### First Step to Get Started

<h1>Install a micromamba environment by yml file </h1>

-- First install micromamba
brew install micromamba

-- Next, create the environment using yml file provided
micromamba create -f insurance_prediction.yml

-- activate the environment you created above
micromamba activate insurance_prediction
(you can list all the environments by 'micromamba env list' command)

-- connect the jupyter lab and write python code
jupyter lab
